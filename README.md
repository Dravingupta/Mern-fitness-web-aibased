Indian AI Fitness Coach
Your Personalized "Guru-ji" for Health & Wellness
Indian AI Fitness Coach is a modern, AI-powered progressive web application (PWA) designed specifically for the Indian demographic. Unlike generic fitness apps, it leverages Google's Gemini 3 Pro & 2.5 Flash models to generate hyper-personalized diet and workout plans that respect Indian regional cuisines, dietary restrictions (Veg, Non-Veg, Jain), and budget levels.
Whether you are looking to lose fat, build muscle, or maintain general fitness, this app acts as a 24/7 personal coach that fits right in your pocket.
